<h1>Signal Processing and Mathematical Concepts</h1> <p>This repository explores key mathematical concepts and approaches used in signal processing. The main focus is on analyzing signals in both time and frequency domains through the use of eigenfunctions and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Here's a detailed overview of the concepts, approaches, results, and relevant formulas.</p> <h2>Mathematical Concepts</h2> <h3>1. Signal Definition</h3> <p>A signal is defined as a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. In mathematical terms, a continuous-time signal <code>x(t)</code> can be represented as:</p> <pre><code>x(t): R -> R</code></pre> <h3>2. Fourier Transform</h3> <p>The Fourier Transform is a fundamental tool in signal processing. It decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies. The continuous Fourier Transform of a function <code>x(t)</code> is given by:</p> <pre><code>X(f) = ∫ x(t) e^(-2πift) dt</code></pre> <p>For discrete signals, the DFT is used:</p> <pre><code>X[k] = Σ x[n] e^(-2πikn/N)</code></pre> <h3>3. Eigenvalue Problems</h3> <p>In this analysis, kernel methods are utilized to derive eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, which offer insights into signal characteristics. The kernel function is defined as:</p> <pre><code>K(x, y) = sin(2πf * (x - y)) / (x - y)</code></pre> <h2>Approaches</h2> <h3>1. Kernel Function Implementation</h3> <p>The kernel function is implemented to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a kernel matrix, crucial for identifying dominant signal features. The kernel function is expressed in Python as:</p>
def kernel_tau(x, W=1):
    """Convenient function to compute kernel of eigenvalue problem."""
    x = np.asanyarray(x)
    y = np.pi * np.where(x == , 1.e-20, x)  # avoid divide by zero
    return np.sin(2 * W * y) / y

<h3>2. DFT Visualization</h3> <p>3D visualization techniques are employed to demonstrate the relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations. This is accomplished using the following approach:</p>
def drawDFTView(X, ax=None, fig=None):
    """Draws 3D diagram given DFT matrix."""
    a = 2 * np.pi / len(X) * np.arange(len(X))
    d = np.vstack([np.cos(a), np.sin(a), np.abs(X).flatten()]).T
    # Additional plotting logic...

<h2>Results</h2> <p>The implementation of the above approaches yields comprehensive results, including:</p> <ul> <li>3D representations of signals and their frequency spectra.</li> <li>Identification of dominant frequencies through eigenvalue analysis.</li> <li>Visual clarity in understanding the relationship between time-domain signals and their spectral components.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>This repository illustrates the intersection of mathematical concepts and practical signal processing techniques. The application of Fourier analysis, kernel methods, and innovative visualization provides valuable insights into the behavior of signals.</p> <h2>License</h2> <p>This project is licensed under the MIT License.
